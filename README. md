Getting And Cleaning Data Project
Author: Federico M. Arnao Martin

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Data
The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web site:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
This file containts: 
* **./train/X_train.txt** Training Set
* **./train/y_train.txt** Training Label
* **./train/subject_train.txt** The subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
* **./test/X_test.txt** Test Set
* **./test/y_test.txt** Test Label
* **./test/subject_test.txt** The subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
* **./features_info.txt** Information about the variables used on the featuer vector.
* **./features.txt** List of all features.
* **./activity_labels.txt** Activity name.

## Steps
* **Step 1** Load and merge train and test dataset Sets. The data.frame resulted is mergeSet (merge ./train/X_train.txt y ./test/X_test.txt).
* **Step 2** Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* **Step 3** Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. The data.frame resulted is mergeLabel.
* **Step 4** Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. The data.frame resulted is cleanedData (= mergeSubject + mergeLabel + mergeSet)
* **Step 5** From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
